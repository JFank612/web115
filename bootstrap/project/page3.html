        <p>Diets are a huge part of a healthy lifestyle, and usually need to be followed pretty strictly. There are many different types of diets that can help you in different ways. There are diets to help lose weight, to help gain muscle and mass, or simply just gain weight, and there are even diets that help change the way you look at and react to certain food groups, almost a restart button for yourself. So once you have figured out what your goal is with your health, you then could match up your goals to matching diets and reasearch them to see which one would be best. Another thing you could do, is simply try out some diets and see how your health and body are affected after a short period of time.</p>
        <p>There are many diet programs out there that give you predetermined meal plan for you based on your body type. You got one of the firsts of its kind, with the<a style="font-size: 1em; font-family: 'Arvo', serif; color: darkblue;" href="http://www.jennycraig.com/">Jenny Craig</a>diet plan. Its seems that these are trending so well, to the point that they even have delivery services with a predetermined amount you will get for each meal. examples of those consist of<a style="font-size: 1em; font-family: 'Arvo', serif;color: darkblue;" href="https://www.blueapron.com/">Blue apron</a> and <a style="font-size: 1em; font-family: 'Arvo', serif; color: darkblue;" href="https://www.hellofresh.com/">Hellofresh</a>.</p>
        <p>Below, I have included a few other popular diets. The South Beach diet is another one of the diet programs that you can sign up for. Now the next one to that, is the Paleo diet. That is one where you cut out certain food groups, and have to limit yourself to a specified amount of food a day. This one, you create your own meal plan, and have to go out and buy all your groceries yourself. The last one I have provided on here, is the Whole30 program. I said program, not cause you have to sign up and have predetermined meals, but because its more than just a diet, its more of a complete new lifestyle. It is a more strict version of the paleo diet that you actually do for a minimal of 30 days. </p>
