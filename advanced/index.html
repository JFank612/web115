                    <p>Hi, all. My name is Joel Fankhauser and this is how I got into the coffee business. It all started with my first cup of joe. After that, everything seemed to fall into place, and my love for coffee was born. I started this coffee shop not only to give everyone a delicious cup of joe, but to help bring everyone together also. I want everyone to feel like this is their home away from home, no matter the distance. </p>
