    <h1>Where it all started</h1>
	  <img style="float: right" src="cdm_87829_0.jpg" alt="Before it was Red Rocks">
	  <p>The beginning of Red Rocks started over 200 million years ago, when the natural formation we have today first started to form. It wasn't till 1906 though, when John Brisben Walker had visions of turning these amazing formations into what it is today. It wasn't much longer though after though, that the land was purchased from Mr. Walker by the city of Denver to continue his dream. In 1928, when Denver purchased the 728 acres of land, they started building off the foundation Mr Walker had planned out. In 1941, it was officially open to the public. It held small concerts from the beginning, but it wasn't until 1964 that they finally had its first big act, with The Beatles. Since then, Red Rocks started to get discovered by other musicians, like Jimi Hendrix in 1968 and U2 in 1983. Red rocks has been deemed some of the greatest performances by bands that have playe there, and is still going strong to this day.   </p>
