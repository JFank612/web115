    <p>Red Rocks is close to having its 77th anniversary for performances, but it has been holding concerts even before then. It actually has been holding concerts for more than a hundred years now! The first ever show that it held was a musician by the name of  Pietro Satriano and his band back in 1906. in 1911, renowned opera singer Mary Garden performed and claimed it as the best performance she ever did. Since then, it has brought in some of the biggest artists of all time to perform. </p>
    <h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
    <p>My first time at Red rocks was in June 2014 when I went to see O.A.R. and American Idol winner Phillip Phillips. When I first got there, I just couldn't believe the beauty of the place, even on the outside of it. Then I got inside of the venue, and I was in complete shock because of everything it had to offer. From the top of the venue, not only do you see down into the ampitheater itself, but beyond that, you could see the beauty of the scenery the state of Colorado has to offer. So you are not just getting a concert, but you are getting a show too with everything in the background. You get to watch the day turn to night, and  get to experience the entire beauty of the state of Colorado too. My second show I got to see was equally as great as the first. My girlfriend and I got to see her personal favorite band, City and Colour open for Ben Harper. That night was truly amazing as we got to watch the weather change as it turned from a nice clear day to a rainy night, while enjoying the show. </p>
