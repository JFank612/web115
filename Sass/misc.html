    <p>One day, you could be at Red Rocks seeing your favorite band, and the next day you could be back getting your daily workout in. Red Rocks has more to offer than just concerts and performances. On certain days of the year, the ampitheater transforms into a workout studio, and Easter sunday, it even transforms into a church. If you are truly in love with this place (which I am), you can even have your wedding there! They have other fun things too with their interior, such as their own Hall of Fame for musicians that have been through. Red Rocks is not only the ampitheater, but also is a Colorado park with hiking and biking trails surrounding it. </p>
